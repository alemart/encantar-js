## Fundraising

Developing an Augmented Reality engine from scratch with Computer Vision is a massive undertaking. Here's how you can support development:

* [Purchase your copy of the software](https://encantar.dev/buy)
* [Buy the Add-Ons](https://encantar.dev/addons)
* [Sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/alemart)

If you use the software commercially, it's especially important to purchase your copy and support the project on which you rely.

Ultimately, the funding comes back to you as more software, increased value, and greater enjoyment!

## Features

* **Image tracking**: track detailed images such as cartoons or photos. Import your [custom images](https://encantar.dev/guidelines-for-images) and see that it just works! This is also known as Natural Feature Tracking.
* **Pointer tracking**: create interactive experiences based on touch and mouse input with an easy-to-use API.
* **Plugins**: use encantar.js with the 3D engine of your choice: [A-Frame](https://encantar.dev/api/plugin-aframe/), [babylon.js](https://encantar.dev/api/plugin-babylon/), [three.js](https://encantar.dev/api/plugin-three/), or any other!
