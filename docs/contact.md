# Contact

I'm Alexandre, the developer of encantar.js. I can help you with this engine and with related technologies. Get in touch if you'd like me to:

* Work on projects that you want created or modified
* Answer technical questions

I help techies and non-techies get things done. My experience is vast and you may find it quite useful! Besides AR, my experience includes: game development, computer vision, algorithms, mathematical modelling, 3D, full-stack web development, mobile app development, and more.

If you're not a technical person and have a project in mind, simply describe the specification in a short text and tell me how much time you'd like to put into its development. If possible, include links to similar projects and to pages containing additional information.

I usually work by myself, but I can also work with a team of like-minded people. Prototypes can often be built in a matter of days &ndash; as long as the spec is clear.

If you're a techie, then you can ask me technical questions. I can guide you step by step if you're a junior, or give you pointers if you're more experienced.

Sounds good? Contact me via e-mail: <pre>:mailbox_with_mail: <a href="#" class="email"></a><noscript>support@[this domain]</noscript></pre>
